Docker Feed is a simple and convenient tool for handling deployment of docker compose files to a Swarm environment.
By convention, it locates all stacks to deploy on a [JFrog](https://jfrog.com/) feed with every stack following a docker-compose filename pattern of `docker-compose.my-stack-name.yml`.

Additionally, the Swarm probably needs to initialize some network infrastructure before any stacks are deployed. This is also handled by a simple convention of treating a set of `infrastructure` stacks as yaml files with network details. By default the stack named `infrastructure`, thus the filename `docker-compose.infrastructure.yml`, will be considered as infrastructure deployment.

The content of `docker-compose.infrastructure.yml` should contain network details for the Swarm which will be created on `init`, as such:

```yaml
networks:
  swarm_encrypted_network:
    encrypted: true
  swarm_unencrypted_network:
    encrypted: false
```

## Install Or Upgrade
- pip install --upgrade DockerFeed

## Prerequisites
- python3x
- Docker:
  - https://www.docker.com/get-docker

## Usage
The Docker Feed tool is available as the command line tool `dockerf`.
Handle the docker feed by adding any of the following commands with zero or more stacks to handle.
- `init` - Initialize Swarm.
- `deploy` - Deploy stacks to Swarm.
  - Adding no specific stacks to deploy will result in deploying all stacks.
  - Example: `dockerf deploy first-stack second-stack`
- `rm`/`remove` - Remove stacks from Swarm.
  - Adding no specific stacks to remove will result in removing all stacks.
  - Example: `dockerf remove first-stack second-stack`
- `ls/list` - List stacks on feed.
    - Hint, add search criterias following `ls`, such as:
    - `dockerf ls first-stack second-stack`
- `prune` - Remove all stacks.
- `pull` - Pull stacks from feed.
- `push` - Push docker-compose files to feed.
  - Example: `dockerf push docker-compose.first-stack.yml docker-compose.second-stack.yml`
- `verify` - Verify that the stacks are properly configured.
    - Following requirements are validated:
        1. All images must be tagged with an immutable [digest](https://success.docker.com/article/images-tagging-vs-digests).
        2. Verify that all images are labeled with following labels (Optional and activated by adding `--verify-images`):
            - org.opencontainers.image.created
            - org.opencontainers.image.authors
            - org.opencontainers.image.revision
            - org.opencontainers.image.version
            - org.opencontainers.image.documentation
            - org.opencontainers.image.title
        3. Additional validation checks are optional:
            - `--verify-no-configs`
            - `--verify-no-secrets`
            - `--verify-no-volumes`
            - `--verify-no-ports`
- Optional arguments:
  - `-u/--user` to specify user credentials for jfrog as `user:password`.
  - `-t/--token` to specify a token for jfrog.
  - `-f/--feed` to specify the jfrog feed. Default is `docker-delivery`.
  - `-s/--storage` to specify a storage folder to use for local storage of compose files.
  - `-e/--env` with environment variables to expose as `envKey=envValue`:
    - `dockerf dp -e key1=variable1 key2=variable2`
    - Alternatively, any present `.env` will be considered as a file with environment variables to expose.
  - `--ignored-stacks` followed by a list of stacks to ignore.
  - `--uri` to specify the jfrog uri. Default is `https://artifacts/`.
  - `--offline` to work offline.
  - `--remove-files` to remove matching docker-compose file from local storage when removing stacks from the Swarm.
  - `--verify-uri` to verify the jfrog uri certificate.
  - `--verify-stacks-on-deploy` to deploy only valid stacks.
  - `--verify-images` to validate required labels on images.
  - `--verify-no-configs` to validate that no Swarm configs are used in stack.
  - `--verify-no-secrets` to validate that no Swarm secrets are used in stack.
  - `--verify-no-volumes` to validate that no Swarm volumes are used in stack.
  - `--verify-no-ports` to validate that no ports are exposed in stack.
  - `-i/--infrastructure` to specify which infrastructure stacks to use. Default is `infrastructure`.
  - `-h/--help` for help:
    - `dockerf -h`
